[Project]

projectName = (Shorthand title for project)
projectDescription = (A few more informations on the project. May be one or two sentences.)

; Allow data points (or images, for the classification case) not to have a label at all (e.g. for "background" samples)
enableEmptyClass = yes

; Type of annotations the user can provide in the UI. One of {'labels', 'points', 'boundingBoxes'}.
annotationType = labels

; Type of annotations the model predicts. Note that this may be different from the "annotationType" property. For example, a setup could have users provide classification labels, but a model predicting points. In this case, "annotationType" would be "classLabels", "predictionType" would be set to "points". Note that this would require translating to usable ground truth in the AI model.
predictionType = boundingBoxes

; For bounding boxes: minimum size (width and height) of a box to be considered valid.
; Invalid boxes (i.e., those drawn too small by users) will automatically be inflated to be of
; the given size.
; Note that boxes with zero width and/or height will always be discarded.
box_minWidth = 20
box_minHeight = 20

; Admin user for the project that is automatically added during project creation
adminName = admin

; General server settings
[Server]
host = 0.0.0.0
port = 8080

; URL under which the (potentially dedicated) file server can be reached that stores the image data
; Note that this may include the port and static URI of the file server instance.
; For the first, it must correspond to the 'port' entry of this section of the file server's configuration
; file. For the second, it must be identical to the 'staticfiles_uri' entry in section 'FileServer'
; of the file server's configuration file.
; Only set to localhost, 127.0.01, etc. if *all* of AIde's services are to be run on the same machine.
; Otherwise, if e.g. a dedicated AIController instance is to be run, it will look for a FileServer instance
; on itself, which will throw an error.
dataServer_uri = fileserver.example.com/aide

; Similar principle for the AIController (host name and port). Leave empty or remove if no AI backend
; is needed (i.e., only the labeling interface is required).
; Also here: only set to loopback (localhost, etc.) if all AIde services are run on just a single machine.

; Carry over the predictions as annotations automatically. If set to yes, every prediction made by the
; model will automatically count as an annotation added (resp. verified) by the user, unless they delete it.
; Notes:
; - If annotationType = labels, the annotation label will be chosen as per the carryOverRule below
; - If predictionType = boundingBoxes and annotationType = points, bounding boxes will be converted to points
; - If predictionType = points and annotationType = boundingBoxes, points will be converted to bounding boxes
;   with default width and height as specified below
; - If carryOverPredictions = no, predictions might be shown (see above), but are immutable
carryOverPredictions = yes
; Minimum confidence for predictions to be considered for carryover

[FileServer]

; File system directory on FileServer instance that hosts all the images to be shown in the interface.
